In 3js, always the x,y,z are at the center of our cube/object. Thus, we add/subtract half of our width/height to it, to get the edge point i.e top,left,etc.

3js "THREE.Mesh" dosen't provides a "height" property by default.
So we create a class named "Box" which inherits Mesh and has height prop so that we can reference height and change it.

===> Collision detection logic:

- Check at which point the bottom of the Box and top of the Ground intersect.
- Get bottom of cube = console.log(cube.position.y - cube.height / 2)
- Get top of ground = ground.position.y + ground.height / 2

===> As we moved ground position 'y' below by '-2', then we have to update the original position of ground object as it gives error while collision detection.
